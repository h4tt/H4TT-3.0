Disclaimer:
This is the last of the "Easy" challenges I'll make, meaning that it can be solved by simply finding 
some string being created in memory. (I'd rather not make a ton of these, while they're fun, once you're
alright at reversing, they become easy)

Solution:
Instead of having one single thread, I now have four. This means that you can't just set a breakpoint and 
check the value on the stack. In addition, the string is on the heap anyway. The solution is to go find 
the three functions executed by the threads, and moticing they're placing a string somewhere in jumbled order
and clearing it, so even if you were to observe the memory buffer, you'll find that it's never fully formed.
Reassembling the pieces of the string, you get the flag:

flag{5cr3w_th15}

*screw this, as in the 'threads' on a screw*
