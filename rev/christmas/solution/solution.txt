This challenge doesn't have much to it. I've packed the executable using UPX packing,
and a surprising small amount of people don't know much about process packing, much less
how to circumvent it. 

You can unpack this executable manually by running it in a debugger, finding the original 
entry point, then dumping it, or simply using the UPX application provided at upx.github.io.
Afterwards, you'll see a simple stack string which you can see by observing the code in a debugger
(or setting a breakpoint after the stack string is set)
