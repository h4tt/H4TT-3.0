The server sends out a cookie with the flag when making a get request to /fast-cookies with a max age of 1 milisecond. However if you go into the dev-tools and look at the cookes they won't show. The only way to view it is to check the headers either via a `curl -i` request, going into the dev-tools and looking at the header under the network tab. Or to check it out with burpsuite.
