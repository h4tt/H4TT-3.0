The image was encrypted with AES ECB, you can read about the technique here: https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin/
The code that was used to encrypt was similar, with only the password being changed:

head -n 4 tux.ppm > header.txt
openssl enc -aes-128-ecb -nosalt -pass pass:"asdhfaasdfjljhqj234k5j234g" -in tux.ppm -out image.enc

First you need to rebuild the header. You can learn about the PPM format here: http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ppm/

Then, concatinate the header with the encrypted image:
cat header.txt image.enc > tux.enc.ppm

And you can see the flag in tux.enc.ppm

flag{the_walls_are_ecb}
