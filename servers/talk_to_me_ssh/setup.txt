This challenge needs to be hosted on a remote server. Contestants are to have
*unprivileged* access.

A docker image has been created to facilitate this while also isolating concurrent
users from each other. Run `make` followed by `make docker` to create it.

On the remote server, if the system supports sysctl, run `sysctl fs.protected_symlinks`
and verify that the value is 0. If the value is 1, run `sysctl -w fs.protected_symlinks=0`.
This security setting needs to be disabled for the challenge to work.

Create an unprivileged user and set its login shell to `run-challenge.sh` to start the
challenge container for each user who connects.
