Looks like this is the end for me. I've barricaded myself in the server room here at Evil Corp. It's only a matter of time. I was able to dump the damning information into /root/flag.txt. But I know you can't access it.

I think I was able to give you something to help get it, I really hope you can.

Best of luck,
