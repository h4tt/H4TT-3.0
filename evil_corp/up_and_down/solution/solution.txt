When obtaining proper access to `/evilcorp-home?file=listing`, the `file` parameter is vulnerable to LFI. Injecting `file=../../etc/shadow.bak` will reveal the backed up readable `/etc/shadow` file. Copying the hash for `evilcorp-user` and throwing it at John the Ripper using a Dictionary attack with the dictionary rockyou.txt. It will eventually reveal to be an MD5 hash that decodes to `1nokungfu`.

Then sshing into evilcorp-user@<docker ip> using the password the terminal will print out the motd with the flag in it.

Flag: flag{f0ll0w_7h3_r4bb17_n30}
