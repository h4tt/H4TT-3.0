When entering the bash shell users have entered a restricted bash shell, with only access to vi, echo. The hint given in the motd is to attempt to point at using the program vi as a way out.

Enter vi. Then press: ESC and type ":!/bin/bash" will return a bash shell. Then change the path variable to gain access to other programs.

`export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin`

Navigate to /tmp and cat out the only file found there and the flag will be in it.

Flag: flag{rb45h_c4n7_570p_m3}
