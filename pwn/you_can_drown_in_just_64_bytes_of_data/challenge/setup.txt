This challenge needs to be hosted on a remote server. Contestants are to have
*unprivileged* access.

A docker image has been created to facilitate this while also isolating concurrent
users from each other. Run `make` followed by `make docker` to create it.

Create an unprivileged user and set its login shell to `run-challenge.sh` to start the
challenge container for each user who connects.
