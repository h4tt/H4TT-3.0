This challenge needs to be hosted on a remote server. Contestants are to have *unprivileged* access.
To setup:

0) If the system supports sysctl, run `sysctl fs.protected_symlinks` and verify that the value is 0.
   If the value is 1, run `sysctl -w fs.protected_symlinks=0`. This security setting needs to be
   disabled for the challenge to work

1) Create a directory called `challenge` with permissions and ownership as follows:

  ```
  mkdir challenge
  chown root:root challenge
  chmod 1777 challenge
  ```

2) Within the `challenge` directory, create the flag and restrict access so that only root can read it
  ```
  echo "flag{h1c0ry_d1c0ry_d0c}" > challenge/flag
  chown root:root challenge/flag
  chmod 600 challenge/flag
  ```

3) Within the `challenge` directory, create the words file and change the owner and group to the user that
   contestants will log in as:
   ```
   echo "Hello there! I have a secret... I bet you'll never guess what it is." > challenge/words.txt
   chown USER:USER challenge/words.txt
   chmod 644 challenge/words.txt
   ```

4) Copy the `talk` executable to the `challenge` directory on the remote server, then change its owner, group,
   and permissions as follows:
  ```
  chown root:root challenge/talk
  chmod 6755 challenge/talk
  ```
